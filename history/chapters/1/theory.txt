    <h2 id="history">History and Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        PL/I (Programming Language One) was developed by IBM in the early 1960s as part of the 
        <strong>System/360</strong> initiative to unify programming across scientific, engineering, and business domains. 
        The language was officially introduced in <strong>1964</strong> after a collaboration between IBM and the 
        SHARE user group.<sup>[1][2]</sup> Its design philosophy aimed to combine the mathematical and numerical 
        computing power of <code>FORTRAN</code> with the data-handling and file-processing strengths of <code>COBOL</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Early compilers were developed for the IBM 7090 and System/360 mainframes, marking PL/I as one of the 
        first general-purpose languages to support structured programming, recursion, and multitasking.<sup>[1][3]</sup> 
        During the 1970s and 1980s, IBM enhanced PL/I with structured programming constructs, advanced I/O features, 
        and robust exception handling, responding to industry demands for reliability in business-critical environments.<sup>[4]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        The language underwent several major implementations including <em>PL/I F</em>, <em>PL/I Optimizing Compiler</em>, and later 
        the <em>Enterprise PL/I</em> series. These developments continued into the 21st century, with IBM releasing 
        <strong>Enterprise PL/I for z/OS 6.1</strong> in 2021, integrating support for Unicode, XML, JSON, and multithreading 
        within IBM’s mainframe ecosystem.<sup>[5][6]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="features">Technical Features and Syntax</h2>
    <p>
        PL/I introduced features that were ahead of its time. It supports a wide range of data types including 
        <code>FIXED</code> and <code>FLOAT</code> numbers, <code>COMPLEX</code> values, character strings, and bit strings. 
        Control structures such as <code>DO</code>, <code>IF</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> allowed developers to express 
        logic in a clear, modular way.<sup>[1][7]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of PL/I’s defining innovations is its <strong>exception handling system</strong>. Using the 
        <code>ON</code> condition and <code>GO TO</code> mechanisms, it allows fine-grained control of runtime 
        anomalies such as file I/O errors and arithmetic overflows. This concept influenced later languages like 
        Ada and C.<sup>[8]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        PL/I also included <strong>tasking and multitasking</strong> capabilities, enabling concurrent execution of 
        code segments—a major advantage for real-time and transaction-heavy applications.<sup>[4][9]</sup> Its 
        compiler was among the first to implement advanced optimization techniques, dynamic storage allocation, 
        and cross-language linkage features that prefigured later advances in compiler design.<sup>[10]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="integration">Integration with IBM Mainframe</h2>
    <p>
        PL/I was designed to take full advantage of IBM mainframes, particularly the 
        <code>z/OS</code>, <code>MVS</code>, and <code>VM</code> environments. It interfaces seamlessly with 
        mainframe subsystems such as <code>VSAM</code> for high-performance file access, 
        <code>IMS</code> for transaction management, and <code>DB2</code> for relational databases.<sup>[5][6]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Using IBM’s <strong>Enterprise PL/I Compiler</strong> and <strong>PL/I Debug Tool</strong>, developers can 
        build, test, and maintain mission-critical systems that run reliably for decades. PL/I also operates 
        within IBM’s <strong>Language Environment (LE)</strong>, allowing interoperability with <code>COBOL</code>, 
        <code>C</code>, and <code>Assembler</code> programs.<sup>[6][9]</sup> This deep integration makes PL/I 
        an enduring choice for banks, insurance firms, and government agencies relying on high-availability systems.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy and Modern Relevance</h2>
    <p>
        Although newer languages such as C, Java, and Python have largely overtaken PL/I in mainstream development, 
        the language continues to thrive in legacy modernization and mainframe automation.<sup>[6][7]</sup> Many 
        large enterprises still run millions of lines of PL/I code on IBM mainframes for critical operations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its design principles influenced subsequent language development, particularly in exception handling, 
        data structure versatility, and multitasking. PL/I remains a cornerstone example of mid-century programming 
        design, bridging the gap between early machine-oriented coding and modern structured paradigms.<sup>[8][9]</sup>
