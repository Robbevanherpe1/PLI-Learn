        <h2 id="history">History and Evolution</h2>
        <p>PL/I was developed in the 1960s by IBM to support both scientific and business applications. As one of the first truly multi-purpose programming languages, it combined the strengths of <code>FORTRAN</code> and <code>COBOL</code>, which were dominant in scientific and business computing respectively. Over the years, PL/I has evolved, adapting to meet the requirements of modern computational systems, especially in large enterprises that maintain legacy systems.</p>
        <p>IBM has continually updated PL/I to keep up with advancements in hardware and software, especially for mainframe systems. These updates include enhanced support for structured programming, error handling, and complex data types, making PL/I a comprehensive language that is particularly effective on IBM’s <code>z/OS</code> and other mainframe operating systems.</p>

        <h2 id="features">Technical Features and Syntax</h2>
        <p>PL/I includes extensive data types and structures, including fixed and floating-point arithmetic, character strings, and bit strings, allowing it to handle diverse and complex data. Its control structures, such as <code>DO</code>, <code>IF</code>, <code>SELECT</code>, and <code>ON ERROR</code>, provide a high degree of control over program execution.</p>
        <p>PL/I’s multitasking capability is one of its hallmark features, allowing a single program to run multiple tasks concurrently. This is especially useful in high-performance computing environments, where parallel execution is key to managing vast amounts of data. Additionally, PL/I’s structured exception handling (<code>ON</code>, <code>GO TO</code>, etc.) allows for sophisticated error handling and recovery, a necessity for mission-critical applications.</p>

        <h2 id="integration">Integration with IBM Mainframe</h2>
        <p>PL/I is optimized for IBM mainframes, particularly <code>z/OS</code>, enabling direct access to system resources. This allows programs to leverage mainframe capabilities, such as Virtual Storage Access Method (<code>VSAM</code>) for file management, <code>IMS</code> for transaction management, and <code>DB2</code> for database operations.</p>
        <p>Through tools like IBM’s PL/I Compiler and Debug Tool, developers can write, compile, and troubleshoot PL/I code effectively. Mainframe integration also enables PL/I to participate in IBM’s Transaction Processing Facility (<code>TPF</code>), which supports high-speed transaction processing in telecommunications and airlines.</p>
